Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
- a0, a1, a2 ... a7 registers contain arguments to functions. Value 13 is in  register a2.

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g?
- There is not a direct function call for f or g function. Compiler inlines them so they are computed in compile time.

At what address is the function printf() located?
- 0x638

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf() in main()?
- 0x30 - value of 1544(ra) in hex is 0x608 and printf is called on address 0x638, so 0x638 - 0x608 is 0x30=ra.

Output of: unsigned int i = 0x00646c72; printf("H%x Wo%s, 57616, &i); In Little endian;
- HE110 World 
- If the RISC-V was big-endian, to get the same output, we would need to change 
  the value of i to 0x726c6400. Value 57616 would remain unchanged.

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y'=?. Why does this happen?
      printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
- The value printed out as y is not specific value.
- Not 100% sure, but I suppose that it prints out value of register a2.
